I'm a graphic designer who learned to love HTML/CSS and sometimes JS. <span title="WHHAAAT? ðŸ˜±">24</span> years later I'm a **front-end developer** focused on **semantics**, **accessibility**. 

I also have a livestreamed show on Sundays called "**Maquetando con Chuck**" where I share what I know about coding HTML and CSS.

## Projects that I'm proud of
